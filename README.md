The campaign is aimed at retaining customers who are about to churn and attracting new customers. The business question for the campaign is "Which are the top five restaurants from the top five areas of Bengaluru City?". The business objective is to launch a campaign which will give heavy discounts on top restaurants. The customer of the campaign could be to remind the customers who are about to churn and to attract new customers.</p>

<p>Above is the flowchart that outlines a process for selecting the top ten restaurants in a given city. The process starts by identifying the top five most populous areas in the city. Next, the distribution of restaurant types in each of these areas is analyzed, and the most popular type of restaurant in each area is selected. Then, the price range of restaurants in each area is considered, and a price range that is likely to appeal to a large number of customers is chosen. Finally, the top ten restaurants within the chosen price range are selected based on their scores, which are calculated by taking an average of the restaurant's rating and the number of votes it has received.</p>
